                            There are plenty of pages explaining how stable diffusion works. This is essentially a mini wiki or cheat sheet. Clicking on a segment provides a very brief explanation and relevant links. The purpose of this mini wiki is to address this simple problem: <br> 
                            Why am I unable to generate the exact image I want? <br> 
                            What tools could help me reach my goal? <br> 
                            This page introduces you to some tools you may find helpful in crafting your images. The focus is on how to obtain what you want rather than how it works. There is so much good resources out there that we try to mostly point to it, with a few filler text here and there. <br><br>

                            Are you just starting, then look at using <a target='_blank' class="external-link" href='https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus'>Fooocus</a>. 
                            If you want more control yet don't want to bother tweaking your interface use <a target='_blank' class="external-link" href='https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic'>SD.Next</a>. 
                            If you want to customize your interface with lots of extra addons and want to be on the bleeding edge and don't mind a few things breaking you can use <a target='_blank' class="external-link" href='https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui'>Auto1111</a>. 
                            If you love inpainting, outpainting and just a great UI and canvas you can use <a target='_blank' class="external-link" href='https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI/'>InvokeAI</a>. 
                            Finally, if you want advance pipelines and workflows and love node based interfaces you can use <a target='_blank' class="external-link" href='https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI'>ComfyUI</a> <br><br>

                            The next step is whether you can run model locally or you need to use the cloud. Go on your system info and check your graphics card. Go to graphics and check the name of your graphics card. For instance on the computer I am typing this it says GeForce RTX 3050Ti. If you google your graphic card you can find out how much VRAM you have. For me on this device it is 4GB which is just enough to run stable diffusion locally. If you have 4GB VRAM (not RAM) or more, then you can install and run stable diffusion locally. If not then you will have to use a cloud provider for instance use a template from <a target='_blank' class="external-link" href='https://www.runpod.io/'>Runpod</a> or <a target='_blank' class="external-link" href='https://vast.ai/'>Vast.ai</a> <br><br>

                            NB: Bigger area does not mean more important! We have plenty of gaps in what we capture, things are moving so fast! Thank you to many on reddit who have made suggestions, keep them coming!
